To build and debug .NET 6 iOS applications from Visual Studio 2019 you must manually install the .NET 6 SDK and iOS workloads on both
**Windows and macOS** (Mac build host).

If while connecting Visual Studio to your Mac through XMA you are prompted to install a different version of the SDK, you can ignore
that since it refers to the legacy one.

> Note: currently only the iOS simulator is supported.
