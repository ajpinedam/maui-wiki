[.NET 7 previews](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-7-preview-1/) have begun shipping! After .NET MAUI GA release ([see roadmap](https://github.com/dotnet/maui/wiki/Roadmap)), we will start including .NET MAUI workloads in the .NET 7 preview releases. Until then, .NET MAUI requires .NET 6. 

> From Visual Studio 2022, no changes are needed to continue building .NET MAUI applications

To pin your applications to .NET 6 for the time being, use a `global.json` within your project directory.

```json
{
    "sdk": {
      "version": "6.0.200",
      "rollForward": "latestMinor"
    }
  }
```
