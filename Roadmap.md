# Upcoming Milestones

## **.NET MAUI Release Candidate (Q1 2022)**

During the first quarter of the year we will continue shipping previews until we reach the quality and completeness for a Release Candidate. For more details about what work is currently underway in this period, visit the [project boards](https://github.com/dotnet/maui/projects). 

## **.NET MAUI GA (Q2 2022)**

During this second quarter of the year we will continue shipping release candidates until we reach the quality to ship a GA (general availability) release. The focus of these sprints will be on the quality of the features readying for GA.

## **.NET 7 (Q2 - Q4 2022)**

Once .NET MAUI GA ships with .NET 6 and Visual Studio 2022, the focus will shift to .NET 7 tasks as summarized on [themesof.net](https://themesof.net/). We will rejoin the in-progress preview releases of .NET 7 and sync up our GA schedule with the .NET 7 GA release later in the year.
